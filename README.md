# Automating CI/CD with GitHub Actions and Python FastAPI - Demo Web Application

## Workflow Overview

The workflow orchestrates tasks, including setting up the development
environment, running tests, building Docker images, and deploying the
application locally. Notably, it incorporates Grype, an open-source tool,
for Docker image vulnerability scanning, ensuring a secure and automated
deployment pipeline.
This repository facilitates the deployment of a web application into
preferred Linux VMs. Typical uses would be deployment to Kubernetes,
demos of Docker, CI/CD (build pipelines are provided), deployment to
cloud (AWS) monitoring.
It takes ~5-6 min to deploy Web App Server.

## Requirements

- AWS account
- Terraform >= 1.0.4
- Ansible core >= 2.0
